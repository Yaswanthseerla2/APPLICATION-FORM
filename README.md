# APPLICATION-FORM

A basic job application form project involves creating a digital form that allows individuals to submit their personal and professional information when applying for a job. Here's a general description of how such a project might be structured:

Form Fields: Design the form to collect relevant information from job applicants. This typically includes fields such as:

Personal Information: Name, contact details (email, phone number, address).

Additional Questions: Any specific questions or prompts related to the job or company.
Validation: Implement validation for the form fields to ensure that the submitted information is accurate and complete. This may include checking for required fields, validating email addresses, enforcing character limits, etc.

User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for the form using HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript for interactivity. The form should be easy to navigate and visually appealing.
